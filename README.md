# Reinforcement-Learning-Agent-Q-Learning-Transformer-RL-
Implements Q-learning and optionally Decision Transformer-style architecture in a custom GridWorld or CartPole environment. Adds visualizations of learned policies and reward convergence.
Reinforcement Learning is core to robotics, agents, and control. This project shows you understand temporal decision-making, exploration, value estimation, and even transformer-based RL.


This project implements tabular Q-learning on a GridWorld task, with an extension using a transformer to encode sequential state-action data.

### Features:
- Epsilon-greedy exploration
- Policy heatmaps and convergence plots
- Optional: transformer-based value estimator

### Skills Demonstrated:
- Q-learning algorithm
- Sequential decision-making
- RL + deep learning integration
